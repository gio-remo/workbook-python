## Notes from the Py4e, by Dr. Chuck

Dr. Charles R. Severance (aka [Dr. Chuck](https://www.dr-chuck.com/)) is a CS professor at the University of Michigan.

He is the creator of several, completely open-source, MOOCs about different programming languages.

[www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) has published a course based on the Dr. Chuck's "Python for Everybody" ([www.py4e.com](https://www.py4e.com/)) lessons.

Here there are my notes and solutions to exercises.
