# Exercise 5.1
# Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters “done”. 
# Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. 
# If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using 
# try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.
